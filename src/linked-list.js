 * Should have the methods: `addToTail`, `removeHead`, and `contains`.
 * `addToTail` replaces the tail with a new value that is passed in.
 * `removeHead` removes and returns the head node.
 * `contains` should searth through the linked list and return true if a matching value is found.
 * The `head` property is a reference to the first node and the `tail` property is a reference to the last node.
 * These are the only two properties that you need to keep track of an infinite number of nodes.
 * Build your nodes with objects.
